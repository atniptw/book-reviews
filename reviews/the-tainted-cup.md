## Review

This book was an absolute delight to read. The creative implementation of magic powers and their associated drawbacks made for a compelling and unique narrative. The audiobook production enhanced the experience significantly, bringing the story to life in an engaging way.

## What I Liked

- Innovative and fun approach to magic powers with meaningful trade-offs
- Engaging mystery plot that kept me invested throughout

## What I Disliked

- The descriptions of eating unpleasant things were sometimes overly detailed and graphic
- The mystery could have provided more clues to allow readers to solve it alongside the characters

## Additional Notes

No additional notes.
