## Review

This book offers a rich and immersive story with extensive world-building and background detail. The audiobook production quality is excellent, enhancing the overall experience. The narrative is filled with intricate plot threads and deep lore that creates a vivid and complex world.

## What I Liked

- Rich world-building that creates an immersive fantasy setting
- Good suspenseful scenes that keep you engaged
- Rich descriptions that bring the world to life

## What I Disliked

- The main character is supposed to be smart, but often comes across as just very lucky rather than truly clever
- The extensive world-building sometimes became overwhelming and detracted from the main story
- The pacing felt uneven—it felt like we started three or four different stories before getting to the "real" story

## Additional Notes

This book is best suited for readers who enjoy deep world-building and don't mind a slower-paced narrative with extensive background lore. While the audiobook format helps manage the dense descriptions, be prepared for a story that takes its time establishing the world before fully diving into the central plot.
