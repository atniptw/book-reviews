## Review

This is an excellent follow-up and continuation of the story. It maintains the quality of the first book while still feeling fresh and original, never falling into the trap of being just an empty "part 2." The world-building continues to be engaging and increasingly interesting as more layers are revealed.

## What I Liked

- Maintains the quality of the first book while still feeling fresh and new rather than a formulaic sequel
- The world-building remains consistently engaging and fascinating

## What I Disliked

- At times, I still struggle to figure out the mystery before the reveal

## Additional Notes

No additional notes.
