## Review

Bill Nye is undoubtedly smart, and the topics covered are refreshingly nerdy. However, I think I'll continue to associate him primarily with the Science Guy show for the nostalgia it brings rather than for this particular book.

## What I Liked

- Engaging nerdy topics that spark curiosity
- Abundant passion and enthusiasm (especially in the audiobook narrated by the author)

## What I Disliked

- The book felt like it failed to deliver a cohesive central point
- The messaging often turned rambling and lost focus

## Additional Notes

I picked up this book because I loved Bill Nye's show as a kid, and I appreciate his efforts to help people embrace science and critical thinking. Unfortunately, this particular book didn't resonate with me as I had hoped. While his passion for science and learning is evident throughout, the execution didn't quite deliver the impact I was expecting.
