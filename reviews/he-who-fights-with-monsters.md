## Review

This is a really funny and witty book that kept me entertained throughout. I listened to the audiobook version, and the narration enhanced the experience. The character strengths and skill progression made sense and felt well-balanced, avoiding the all-too-common "magic main character must never lose" vibe that plagues many similar stories. The RPG mechanics were engaging and added depth to the narrative.

## What I Liked

- Funny and witty dialogue and situations
- Good character development throughout the story
- Characters felt real and believable
- RPG mechanics were well-integrated into the story

## What I Disliked

- Jason can get repetitive with his monologues at times
- Reading out the entire character sheet every chapter (or what felt like it) became annoying and disrupted the flow

## Additional Notes

This book is perfect for fans of LitRPG and progression fantasy. The humor sets it apart from other books in the genre, making it a refreshing read. Despite a few pacing issues with repetitive elements, the overall experience was excellent.
